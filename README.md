# TeachYourselfGameEngineering
<h1>Foreword</h1>
Here is my personal and truly comprehensive roadmap to be a game developer. I want to share it with you, because knowledge and methodology is a shared property that that gets better when many people are involved.
I use phrase **Game Engineering** because I believe in scientific approach and I think that a true developer also should be an engineer. The study goal is build your own game engine with advanced features such as a rendering system, UI, AI, a physics and collision system, networking support etc. I'm sure that it helps you to totally understand modern game development approach and you will be able to use this knowledge to wide your expertise.
