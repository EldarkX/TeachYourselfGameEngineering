# TeachYourselfGameEngineering
<h1>Foreword</h1>
<p>Here is my personal roadmap on how to become a game engineer. I want to share it with you because I feel that the knowledge base should be available to anyone free of charge and the more people we get involved the better.

I use such phrasing as <strong>Game Engineering</strong> because I believe in a scientific approach and I think that a true developer is also an engineer. The ultimate goal is to build your own game engine with advanced features such as rendering system, UI, AI, physics and collision system, networking support etc. 

I'm certain that this roadmap may help you to understand a modern game development approach better as well as widen your technical expertise.</p>

<h2>0. Before we start</h2>
<p>On this journey  of learning a lot of new knowledge you need both a motivation and a proper approach to learn. I strongly suggest you to read <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/">Deep Work by Cal Newport</a> and <a href="https://barbaraoakley.com/books/learning-how-to-learn/">Learning How To Learn by Barbara Oakley</a> books. These books help you prepare to the hard work and you will be studying much more efficiently.</p>

 <p>I advise you not to skip recommended resources. Also if you want to become an outstanding game engineer you should deal with all additional resources and try to find any more!</p>

<h2>1. Math Prerequisites</h2>
<p> The question "Is math necessary for a software engineer?" is disscussed by experts all programming history, but for game engineer math surely is one of most important domains. If you want to work on rendering systems, or design AI systems, or implement physics systems, or develop gameplay features etc, the math will be either a helpful ally or a hateful enemy.!
